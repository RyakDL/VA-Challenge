  Comment: This was used as a VBA starter code. I used the code to build loops and conditional statements and learned different VBA functions and codes in the process. I changed the code to replicate the objectives and       formatting called for in the instructions.

Overall Comment on VBA Module and Homework:

I consider myself an advanced Excel poweruser and found the VBA very challenging to learn and execute. I can see the clear benifits of using macros to perform analysis on datasets in conjuction with using pivottables and statistical data modeling in Excel. I do not have a background in coding so my hope is that with practice, using VBA will become easier and I can utilize it in my current job as a risk manager.
